# Hiring - Join us!

Windmill is part of the YC S22 batch.

## Open positions

windmill.dev is looking for its first key people. In particular, we are looking
for the following kind of profiles:

- [Head of BD & Sales](#head-of-bd--sales) - (Remote)
- Founding Engineer: If that is of interest, you might grow as Head of
  Engineering/CTO as the engineering team scale, but you can also chose to stay
  as an IC with significant impact if you prefer. You fit one or ideally a mix
  of those 3 profiles:
  - [Founding Solutions Engineer](#founding-solutions-engineer) - Head of
    Solutions (Remote)
  - [Founding Software Engineer](#founding-software-engineer) (Remote)
  - [Founding DevOps Engineer](#founding-devops-engineer) (Remote)
- Graduate program/Internship: You just graduated and are looking to learn how
  to grow BD, build a startup or write quality software for OSS in a remote
  environment for a period of 3 to 6 months. You will have the opportunity join
  the team at the end.

If you are interested to join the adventure. Apply by sending an email at
hiring@windmill.dev. Be sure to mention which role you are interested in if any
applicable. You may also define your own role!

We are **FULLY REMOTE** forever but we will organize offsites on a regular
basis. If you happen to live in Paris, we have a small office in the 15th
quarter.

### Head of BD & Sales

windmill.dev is a SaaS that can be sold (through dual-licensing) not only to
individual and teams but also to enterprises, either as self-hostable software
or hosted on our cloud. You own the relationship with those companies, including
the sales process and the acquisition funnel.

Furthermore, windmill.dev can potentially grow as a tool for consultancy shops
or as a consultancy itself for automations, it is a plus if you are interested
or have related experience.

### Founding Solutions Engineer

windmill.dev is first and foremost a tool for automations. As a solutions
engineer you will unlock values for customers by leveraging the product in
optimal ways for their specific use cases. You will work directly with somes
companies and unlock value for all by creating great templates, snippets and
integrations in a public and open-source manner.

### Founding Software Engineer

In addition to being a SaaS business, windmill.dev represents a most exciting
technical challenge. We are a small but mighty team and we compete with the
likes of giants. As such, we need to make fast-paced, iterative and sustainable
software design choices. You can find more information about our architecture in
the documentation but overall windmill.dev is a highly available compute
providers, built with rust, postgres, sandboxing (nsjail) and svelte for the
frontend. You will work autonomously as an engineer to make windmill.dev a
delightful, scalable and performant product.

### Founding DevOps Engineer

A large part of windmill.dev business is its hosted SaaS part which implies that
we must ensure high availability in the software and the infrastructure choices
that we make and in the SLA that we offers. As a founding DevOps engineer, you
will ensure that we make the right choices in terms of observability, incident
responses, software design, high-availability and infrastructure. windmill.dev's
current architecture design is stateless replicated rust servers backed by
postgres instances sharded by workspaces id. We use Hetzner Cloud for cost
purposes and run on top of nomad for deployment state management.

## Equity
