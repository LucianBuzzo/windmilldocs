# Preinstall Binaries

Workers can have binaries preinstalled so that they can use them in subprocesses or in bash directly. npm, aws-cli, kubectl and helm are part of the standard images. To include more binaries, simply extend the base image of Windmill.

```
FROM ghcr.io/windmill-labs/windmill:main
# or FROM ghcr.io/windmill-labs/windmill-ee:main for extending ee

RUN apt-get update && apt install ....

CMD ["windmill"]
```
