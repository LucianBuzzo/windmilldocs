# OpenFlow Spec

OpenFlow is an open standard for defining "Flows" where a flow is a directed
graph in which every node represents a step of computation. In other words, it
is a declarative language for chaining scripts.

Windmill is the open-source reference implementation for it, providing an UI to
build flows and a highly scalable executors. However everyone is welcome, to
build upon it to develope new UIs that targets OpenFlow or new executors.

Flows can be shared and showcased on the
[WindmillHub](https://hub.windmill.dev). To see an example of an OpenFlow in
practice, go to WindmillHub and pick a flow (e.g
[Whenever an HN message contains a mention, publish it to slack](https://hub.windmill.dev/flows/13/whenever-an-hn-message-contains-a-mention%2C-publish-it-to-slack)),
then Flow -> JSON.

## OpenFlow

Its OpenApi definition can be found at:
https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/openflow.openapi.yaml

We will use a typescript equivalent of the OpenApi definition for ease of
readability throughout the rest of the document.

OpenFlow is portable and its root object is defined as follows:

```typescript
type OpenFlow = {
  summary: string;
  description?: string;
  value: FlowValue;
  schema?: any;
};
```

It contains a short line summary, a description, a schema which is the
JSONSchema that constraints the JSON it takes as an input. FlowValue is where
the logic of the flow is actually defined:

## FlowValue

```typescript
type FlowValue = {
  modules: Array<FlowModule>;
  failure_module?: FlowModule;
  retry?: {
    constant?: {
      attempts: integer;
      seconds: integer;
    };
    exponential?: {
      attempts: integer;
      multiplier: integer;
      seconds: integer;
    };
  };
};
```

A Flow is just a sequence of modules, and an optional failure module that will
be triggered to handle a failure at any point of the flow.

Retry sets the retry policy for the flow, it is optional and is reset on every
success. `constant` retry just retry N times after a `seconds` delay.
`exponential` applies exponential backoff duration increase in between every
retry. If all the retries are exhausted, the failure module, if any, is called.

Now let's see what is a module:

## FlowModule and InputTransform

```typescript
type FlowModule = {
  summary?: string;
  input_transforms: Record<string, StaticTransform | JavascriptTransform>;
  value: RawScript | PathScript | ForloopFlow;
  stop_after_if?: { expr: string; skip_if_stopped: boolean };
  suspend?: integer;
};

type StaticTransform = {
  type: "static";
  value?: any;
};

type JavascriptTransform = {
  type: "javascript";
  expr: string;
};

type RawScript = {
  type: "rawscript";
  content: string;
  language: "deno" | "python3";
  path?: string;
};

type PathScript = {
  type: "script";
  path: string;
};

type ForloopFlow = {
  type: "forloopflow";
  modules: Array<FlowModule>;
  iterator: InputTransform;
  skip_failures?: boolean;
};
```

So a module contains `input_transforms` as a dict from fields (or input of the
module) to either either a static json value or a javascript expression.

The `input_transforms` is the way to do the piping from any other previous steps
or from variable, or resources to one of the input of your script/module. Since
it is actual javascript (although a restricted javascript, you cannot fetch
externally outside of getting secrets and variables for instance), it is very
flexible. One interesting pattern that is allows is that you can compose complex
string directly from there so you could imagine composing your email body or SQL
query directing from doing a string interpolation using previous result. The
Windmill Editor makes it very easy to do so using the properties picker.

There are also the `stop_after_if` optional object:

If present

- `stop_after_if.expr`: Evaluate a javascript expression that takes the result
  as an input to decide if the flow should stop there. Useful to stop a flow
  that is meant to watch for changes if there are no changes.
- `stop_after_if.skip_if_stopped`: A flag in the case the the above expression
  stops the flow to consider the flow to be a skip or a success. A skip is
  useful in the context of flows being triggered very often to watch for changes
  as you might want to ignore the runs that have been skipped.

The `suspend?` integer represents, when present, the number of events needed to
be received for the flow to be resumed after being paused just after the
execution of the module. This is used for instance for approval flows when a
notification is sent to email/android/slack to approve or disprove the flow
before it is resumed. If the event is of type disprove, the flow is failed
instead of being resumed.

Now let's see how how the Module value is itself defined.

There are 4 kinds of module currently (version 1.26.2):

- `rawscript`: Embed a full Deno or Javascript script inside the flow. Useful
  when the script is not generic but only makes sense within this flow.
- `script`: When you can refer to a script by path (including a path to the hub
  using the `hub/` prefix)
- `flow`: Refer to another flow by path.
- `forloopflow`: Trigger for-loops that will iterate over a list and trigger one
  flow per element. The list is built evaluating the javascript expression
  inside `iterator` taking `result` as an input being the result of the previous
  module. For instance in Windmill, most flows use the iterator `result` and
  expect the previous step to return a list. The flow triggered will take as an
  input the embedding flow inputs, and `iter.value` and `iter.index` as
  respectively the value being iterated and its corresponding index.

Et voil√†, we have completed our tour of OpenFlow.
